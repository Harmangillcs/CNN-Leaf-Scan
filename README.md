# 🌿 PlantCNN: Plant Disease Prediction Using CNN & Images

## 📌 Overview
**PlantCNN** is a Convolutional Neural Network-based image classification model designed to predict and classify various plant diseases using leaf images. The system aims to assist farmers and agricultural experts by providing an AI-powered early warning system for plant health monitoring.

## 🧠 Model Used
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- Image classification to distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves

## 📁 Dataset
- The dataset consists of plant leaf images with labeled disease categories.
- You can download a similar dataset from [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease).

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV (if used for preprocessing)

## 📈 Features
- Predicts plant diseases from leaf images
- Trained on multiple classes of plant conditions
- Shows model accuracy and performance metrics
- Visualizes training and testing accuracy/loss

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PlantCNN.git
   cd PlantCNN
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Plant_Disease_Prediction_CNN_Image_Classifier.ipynb
   ```

## 🖼️ Sample Output
